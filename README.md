# ExplorerDealsAutomation


This repository contains a simple script for converting messy deal data in a CSV file into clean titles, HTML descriptions and short SEO descriptions using the OpenAI API.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (for example in Google Colab or a local environment):
   ```bash
   pip install openai pandas
   ```

2. Prepare a CSV file containing at least two columns named `RawTitle` and `RawDescription`.

3. Run the script providing your OpenAI API key and the input/output file paths:
   ```bash
   python generate_deals.py deals.csv cleaned_deals.csv --api-key YOUR_OPENAI_KEY
   ```
The processed output will be saved to `cleaned_deals.csv` as a standard CSV
file. You can upload this CSV directly to your noâ€‘code platform or import it
into a spreadsheet. The output includes three new columns:

- `Formatted Title`
- `HTML Description`
- `SEO Description`

These columns contain the cleaned and formatted text generated by the script.

You can also set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable instead of passing `--api-key`.
